I"¦<p>How can one learn to do better research apart from just doing research itself? I found maintaining a daily research log and reviewing it on a weekly basis significantly increases the effectiveness of learning to do better research from my everyday research experience. In this blog post, I will discuss how I benefit from logging research and provide some suggestions for maximizing the utility of oneâ€™s everyday research activities.</p>

<p>Why do I log my research</p>

<ul>
  <li>Film study of myself to amplify good research habits</li>
  <li>Learning from past data to do better long-term planning</li>
  <li>Reflect on my errors to do iterative refinement</li>
</ul>
