# Research Interests

- 🔬 Currently, I am working on AI alignment, with a focus on
    - Scalable oversight: Given only human-level supervision, how can we align models beyond human capability? Can we design systems that leverage AI to help us supervise AI? 
    - Semi/Self-supervised methods for alignment: How can AI learn from weakly labelled human data? What happens when AI increasingly participate in supervising other AI systems? If we push this to the extreme, can AI develop their own values based purely on their reasoning capability?

- 🎈 Before working on alignment, I also worked on
    - Cognitive reasoning: How can we explain humans' reasoning process such as intuitive physics and abductive reasoning? How do these explanations inspire understanding of AI?
    - Learning on graphs: How can we better model graph data for applications like recommender systems? How can we ensure these models are designed equally for different users and responsibly for real-world deployment?

- 🧺 Miscellaneous:
    - ✨ I am a co-founder of [HKU AI4Good](https://ai4good-hku.github.io), a student group focused on AI safety, alignment, and undergrad AI research.
    - 🎹 I am a big fan of Vladimir Horowitz! I love classical music, film music, harmony theory, and impromptu piano.
    - 📸 I love photography & cinematography.
    - 🤖️ I was a co-leader of [HKU Astar](https://innowings.engg.hku.hk/astar/), a team that builds cool competitive robots.
    - 🪄 My MBTI: INFJ.
