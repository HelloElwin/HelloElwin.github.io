On April 28th, I took my Nikon Z6 II, armed with a 50mm lens, down to the Sakura Street in Berkeley to capture the annual spectacle of blooming cherry blossoms. I heard that these sakura trees were planted back in 2013. They serve as a living tribute to the universityâ€™s alumni from Japan and those of Japanese ancestry, adding a burst of beauty to the landscape each spring. As I walked down the street, the pink blossoms above seemed to transform the everyday into the extraordinary, and I was there to capture every moment.
