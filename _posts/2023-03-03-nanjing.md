Nanjing is Celine's hometown. She offered me a 5-day guided trip there during the winter break and it was my first time visiting this historical city, which has served as the capital for at least 10 dynasties in Chinese history spanning over 1500 years.

## Snow

I am lucky to have arrived in Nanjing before the snow has melted. Some parts of the city were still covered in snow, which is a rare sight for someone from South China (yes, this is the first time I have ever seen large scale natural snow in my life). The white of the snow blends peacefully with the green of the bushes, creating dreamy and serene scenes like clouds falling from the sky onto the earth.

## Xuanwu Lake

Xuanwu Lake is a large lake in the center of Nanjing. It is surrounded by ancient city walls that are built during the Ming dynasty (about 600 years ago).

## Nanjing as the capital of Republic of China (1912-1949)

Nanjing was the capital of the Republic of China from 1912 to 1949. That period was a time of war for China, but it was also a time of cultural and intellectual flourishing. Walking through streets of Nanjing, one can still see the remnants of that era.

## Yanque Lake

Yanque Lake was a place where the emperors of the Ming dynasty would come to relax and enjoy the view. The autumn leaves surround the lake and are reflected in the water, where swans swim gracefully (actually not, because I saw it stretching its neck ungracefully) across.

## End

I had a great time in Nanjing. The city is full of history and culture, and I am grateful to Celine for showing me around. Her parents are also very kind and hospitable. I hope to visit Nanjing soon again in the future, and I hope that they will come and visit my hometown as well.
